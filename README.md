## Project Description

## Axioms

1. **Axiom of Serenity**: The radio's broadcasts will always emanate a sense of tranquility and inner peace, guiding listeners towards a state of calm and contemplation.

2. **Axiom of Harmony**: The carefully curated music and soundscapes will seamlessly blend together, creating a harmonious and immersive sonic environment.
